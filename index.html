    <h1>Max's Guessing Game</h1>
    <h2>This is my guessing game that I've created for my Code 201 class. It includes a greeting prompt, a variety of yes or no questions about me, a game in-which you try to guess my favorite number, as well as one more fun guessing question.</h2>
    <h4>1. Was I born in the state of Iowa? (yes or no)</h4>
    <h4>2. Is baseball my favorite sport? (yes or no)</h4>
    <h4>3. Is pizza my favorite food? (yes or no)</h4>
    <h4>4. A guessing game where you try to find my favorite number between 1-50.</h4>
    <h4>5. Is Appa the coolest flying bison in existence? (yes or no)</h4>
    <h4>6. How many licks does it officially take to get to the center of a tootsie pop? (enter a number)</h4>
